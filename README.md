# SURVEY-DATA-VISUALIZATION
## Data Science & Analytics Internship – Tamizhan Skills

## Introduction
Survey data is widely collected across domains such as education, food preferences, customer satisfaction, and market research. However, without proper analysis and visualization, valuable insights from survey responses remain under-utilized.
This Survey Data Visualization Project was completed as part of the Data Science and Analytics Internship at Tamizhan Skills. The project focuses on transforming raw survey responses into meaningful visual insights using Python visualization libraries.

## Problem Statement
Survey results often contain large volumes of categorical and rating-based data. Due to poor visualization and analysis, decision-makers struggle to extract actionable insights from survey datasets.

## Objective
The main objectives of this project are:

- To analyze survey data containing multiple-choice responses
- To visualize demographic distributions such as gender
- To identify popular preferences using bar and pie charts
- To explore relationships between variables using heatmaps
- To present survey results in a visually engaging and easy-to-understand format

This project demonstrates how data visualization enhances survey interpretation.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project (Food_preference.csv) is a survey-based dataset containing:
- Timestamp – Survey submission time
- Gender – Participant gender
- Age – Participant age
- Food – Preferred food item
- Juice – Preferred juice
- Dessert – Preferred dessert
- Nationality – Participant nationality

The dataset includes categorical and numeric attributes suitable for exploratory analysis.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas – Data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing
- Matplotlib – Pie charts and basic plots
- Seaborn – Bar charts and heatmaps
- Data Visualization Techniques

## Methodology
The project follows a structured data analysis approach aligned with the provided code:

- Load the survey dataset using Pandas
- Convert timestamp values into proper datetime format
- Generate dataset summary and descriptive statistics
- Analyze gender distribution using a pie chart
- Visualize food preferences using bar charts
- Analyze juice preferences using bar charts
- Analyze dessert preferences using bar charts
- Convert age values to numeric format
- Generate a correlation heatmap for numeric features
- Create cross-tabulation heatmaps:
- Food preference by gender
- Juice preference by nationality

These visualizations provide a comprehensive visual summary of survey responses.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of data visualization in survey analysis. By applying visualization techniques using Python, raw survey responses were converted into meaningful insights. The Tamizhan Skills Data Science & Analytics Internship provided practical exposure to handling real-world survey data and presenting findings visually, which is essential in analytics and business intelligence roles.
